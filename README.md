# AG News Classifier [Team 14]
### Official Github Repository of Team 14 for the Data Mining Project FSS 2022 
#### The following python packages are needed for executing the notebooks:
datasets, pandas, numpy, string, re, matplotlib, nltk, gensim, sklearn, imblearn, scipy, seaborn

#### Structure of the code:
The files **data_graphs.ipynb** and **main.ipynb** include all the code we used for our project.
We split the tasks of executing our code among the team members for
computational reasons. Thus for every classifier we copied the **main.ipynb** file, renamed it accordingly
and executed it for the classifier only. Results for every classifier can be found in the respective files.
